# hello-world
Just starting 

I am a student of Computer Science and Engineering from MBSTU.

I'm young enthusiastic boy and confident about my quality . Also I'm curious to communicate with others as a communicator. I'm interested to know the customer behavior and able to persuade man through positive approach .

As a Social Entrepreneur and Co-founder of Sopnosiri Web and It Solution my passion and big ambitions have led me to many experiential opportunities where I have learned much more about ways to positively innovate in the world.
